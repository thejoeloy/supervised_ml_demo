# supervised_ml_demo
This repository contains demos of the important machine learning algorithms for supervised machine learning. None of these modules use deep learning, but for many tasks, traditional machine learning models are more than sufficient.

## Regression
Linear regression takes a set of parameters and guesses a best fit that is a continuous number


## Classification
Linear Classification takes a set of parameters and generates a guess that is discrete in nature.
